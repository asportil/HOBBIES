# SIMULATOR

This folder contains the code to simulate the thermistor acquisition system on a microcontroller (i.e. Arduino, ESP32, etc.).
The objective is to simulate the behaviour of different algorithms that you could implemente in the microcontroller to measure the temperatures. 
You can then compare their "goodness" in terms of accuracy, precision and delays.

The simulator is written and tested on Octave, an opensource alternative to Matlab.
