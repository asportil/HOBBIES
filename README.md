# THERMISTORS
You are a student, young engineer or just curious about thermistors and you want to use one in your hobby project.
Here I can share with you some of the knowledge I've gather by working with thermistors in different projects (research and hobbies).

# What is a thermistor?
I suppose you already know it, but as a reminder (and simple words) the thermistor is a kind of resistor whose resistance is particularly influenced by the temperature.
If you design your own electronic circuits, in general you don't want that the resitors on your circuit board change with temperature. 
This is because you need specific constant values so that the maths that you have done before building your circuit still holds.

In the case of thermistors there is a remarked sensitivity on the temperature variations, therefore these devices can be used the other way around â†’ to reconstruct a temperature by measuring their resistance value.

We need to focus on (at least) 2 aspects : 
-1 How do we leasure the resistance of a thermistor?
-2 How do we transforml it in a temperature value?

There is an addition aspect, which is actually important, but we are going to neglect it for a moment : the accuracy and the precision.
We are going to tackle these aspects as a last (important) step.
